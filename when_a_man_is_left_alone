# When a Man Is Left Alone
**By Dr. Anthony Onoja**

There comes a time in every man’s life when he must pass through his limbo alone. It becomes either the beginning of his awakening or the start of his damnation. 

It is striking that Jacob did not wrestle with the angel while his family stood beside him. It happened at his most vulnerable moment. His warriors, Levi and Simeon, known for their strength and valor, were not there. He stood alone with his uncertainty, darkness, regret, greed, anger, and pain. It was in that solitude that confrontation came.

### The Myth of the Audience
Jesus, after His baptism, was driven into the wilderness for forty days. Alone among wild beasts, physically weakened, He faced temptation. The devil came when He was isolated. 

Many men boast of discipline, but are you truly disciplined, or are you performing strength for an audience? Only men who have walked through the tunnels of life, seen its vanities such as lust and greed, and carry the scars of restraint can speak with authority about being left alone.

> "The question is not whether you will be left alone, but when."

In Africa, the communal culture has made many men believe that family, friends, and well-wishers will travel with them forever. That is not how life works. There comes a time, sooner or later, when you must face your fear, whether as a young man or as a frail old man. What will you do at your most vulnerable state? That is when you fight the strong man. Have you built endurance for your day of adversity?

### A Personal Reflection
I remember some of my last conversations with my late father. If you knew him, you would know he was not outwardly religious. He would even complain about our loud prayers disturbing his sleep. He prayed in his own way, but he did not believe in spiritual dramatics. He was firm and blunt. 

Yet something changed in his final days. During one call, when I asked how he was feeling, he said:
> *“I wish you all were here. I miss your prayers. I wish I had you around me to go through this difficult time.”* I prayed with him, but I could hear the anguish in his voice. He had sons—strong men, men who had fought their own battles. Yet when he needed us most, we were each facing our own destinies. He had to walk that path largely alone.

### The Seasons of War
Why do I share this? Because dark days come. There will be moments when you must figure life out by yourself. What will you do then? Have you built your spiritual bunker, your safety net, your ark? Do you have the strength to wrestle?

Do not take life lightly. Do not assume your day of testing will never arrive. Scripture says there is a time and season for everything, a time for war and a time for peace. Years bring seasons, seasons bring phases, and phases bring change. 

**Wake up. Do not become spiritually complacent. When men are unprepared, giants of iniquity thrive.**

### What Must You Do?

1. **Develop Strength:** If you fail in the day of adversity, it is because your strength is small. Seek God deeply. Build endurance. Life requires discipline, and spiritual exercise keeps you fit.
2. **Understand the Kingdom:** In this kingdom, we do not fight with physical strength. It is a word-governed universe. The more grounded you are in truth, the larger your spiritual archive becomes. Faith is not built on repetition alone but on rooted conviction.
3. **Cultivate Real Experience:** Can you look beyond your certificates, titles, and positions and fix your eyes on the cross? The cross reminds us that it is not what we did for God, but what He did for us.

When your day alone arrives, the strong man should find you prepared. Your season of solitude can either break you or transform you. It can turn a slave into a prince or a prince into a slave. It can change one man into a nation.

**The choice is yours.**

*Shalom.*
