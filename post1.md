# Jacob’s Meal and the Price of the Birthright
**By Dr. Anthony Onoja**

### The Blunt Truth
Today I want to speak to you bluntly. You may not enjoy reading this, and that is exactly why I must write it.

My dear friend, we have come a long way. You have known me through thick and thin, and I appreciate that. But there is something troubling me, and I cannot stay silent about it. It is your **appetite**—especially your love for what comes easy, the free lunch, the already prepared meal.

### The Trap of the "Free Lunch"
I understand that times are hard and that sometimes it feels like no one cares. But you cannot escape poverty or mental conditioning if you keep settling for crumbs. Your attraction to what is already cooked and served has kept you where you are.

There are moments when you think God has sent you a miracle. But pause and ask yourself: **Is it truly God answering your prayers, or is it temptation disguised as help?** Even in Eden, provision came with responsibility. Man had to tend the garden and obey instruction. Jesus was hungry after forty days of fasting, yet He refused to turn stones into bread because the suggestion came from the enemy. **Not every opportunity is divine.** Why then do you choose Jacob’s cooked meal at the expense of your own raw catch?

### Legacy Over Appetite
If success to you is merely eating and drinking, then you have reduced destiny to appetite. Man was created in the image of God. Do you think godlike living is about comfort without sacrifice? Even redemption required the suffering of the cross.

When a people continually trade long-term inheritance for short-term satisfaction, decline is inevitable. Jacob’s meal always carries a price tag, and that price is:
* **Your Birthright**
* **Your Land**
* **Your Family**
* **Your Future**

### The Shift: From Receiver to Giver
Detest the mentality of dependency. Shift your thinking. **It is more blessed to give than to receive.** That principle is not poetry; it is law. When you constantly position yourself only as a receiver, you weaken your own creative power.

Change begins with individuals. If you can endure lack with dignity and think critically about how to create value with your hands and mind, transformation will begin. The spider is found even in the king’s palace because it works quietly and persistently.

### Recalibrate Your Mindset
Reject the porridge that costs you destiny. Take the pain of development. Roast your own wild catch. Guard your birthright, not only for yourself, but for generations yet unborn.

**The choice is yours.**

*Shalom.*
